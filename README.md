# Spotify-Clone
This project is a recreation of Spotify's front page using only HTML and CSS. 
I focused on implementing a clean layout with well-managed padding and spacing to enhance visual appeal. Additionally, I added engaging hover effects to improve user interaction. The design emphasizes responsiveness and aesthetics, making it visually appealing while ensuring a seamless user experience. Overall, this project showcases my skills in front-end development and my ability to replicate modern web designs.
